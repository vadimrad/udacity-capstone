# Project 5 - Udacity Cloud DevOps Engineer Capstone Project

In this project I've applied the skills and knowledge which were developed throughout the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program. These include:

* Working in AWS
* Using Jenkins to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
* Building pipelines
* Working with CloudFormation to deploy clusters
* Building Kubernetes clusters
* Building Docker containers in pipelines


I've developed a CI/CD pipeline for micro services applications with either blue/green deployment or rolling deployment.
